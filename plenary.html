         <p><b> PRESENTATION: Dealing with Process Disturbances: Different Approaches for their Estimation and Rejection
         </b></p>  
         <p>
            This presentation deals with the problem of disturbance rejection in process control, where disturbances are present. They could be external or generated by model uncertainties. Different
            types of disturbances are considered and also different approaches are outlined to reject or reduce their effects. Some information about the disturbance may be available. Even they can be
            measured. After a general introduction about the relevance of disturbances in process control, the most accepted controller design methodologies based on Disturbance Observers and Active
            Disturbance Rejection approaches are presented and their advantages and limitations when dealing with either non-minimum phase or unstable plants are discussed. The main issues
            involved in each approach are illustrated by different applications. Some conclusions and comparisons are finally drafted and some open problems are presented.
